        I've working with plain Javascript since 2005. <br/>
        Paralelly, I started to work with AngularJs since 2011 (v0.6),
        and I've been using it in a daily basis both on a commercial an personal
        perspective since then.
        Testing is a must for me (unit + functional + integration).

        I'm building HTML & CSS based webapps since 2002. On the recent years,
        I've embraced the capabilities of HTML5 and CSS3 (including LESS & SASS) in order
        to build solutions that
        not only have to work fine, but also have to look really well.
        I really like to work on UI / UX topics, and I build my apps based on the
        mobile-first principle.
