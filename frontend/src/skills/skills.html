    I have 11 years of experience in the scope of the Information Technologies. I’m specialist in the areas of frontend development, usability, user interface, user experience and automated testing.
    <br/><br/>
    I’m a very organized, responsible and committed person. I consider communication, respect and teamwork as the key to personal and professional success.
    <br/><br/>
    Technology enthusiast, my aspirations are related to face new and motivating challenges where I can work as part of a team, contributing with my knowledge and continuously learning from my environment.
    <br/><br/>
    I feel really comfortable working with user interfaces, creating user experience and designing usability stories. Additionally, I really like to interact with OOP Javascript, specially with an MVC framework such as AngularJs in order to be able to build high quality, scalable web applications.
    <br/><br/>
    I have, moreover, experience in the back-end side with Node.js + Express, GruntJs and MongoDb for the persistence topic.
    <br/><br/>
    My favourite tech books are: Javascript: The Good Parts, Mastering Web Application Development with AngularJS and SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS).
